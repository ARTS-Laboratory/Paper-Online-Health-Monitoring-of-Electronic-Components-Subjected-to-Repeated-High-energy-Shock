## modeling

delta_v.py calculates half-sine time and maximum acceleration

metric_plots.py calculates time-series and frequency metrics and produces plots.

time_series_plots.py makes plots from the acceleration data.

prepare_dataset.py prepares the dataset for ML

train.py trains the LSTM model.

prediction_plots.py mades plots from the model's predictions.
